## Design
### Imagery
The imagery used on the CheKnowledge site is very important to the overall experience of the user. A relaxed lightseagreen background is consistently used. This invoke a sense of calm and non-violence in the user.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the page is lightseagreen, a navy and green font is used which as a good contrast with the 
lightseagreen background, with the grey background of the buttons and the white of the dropdown buttons. For the question bar was used a blue navy margin color and a light gray for the bar, this contrast make it easy to see.

### Fonts

The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I am using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font is not being imported into the site correctly.
